# rust_guessing_game

This is a simple Terminal Number Guessing Game utilizing the Rust language.

After cloning the repo, the user can run `cargo run` to build and run the program.

The user will be asked to input a number, which will then be compared to the randomly generated number, and will be told if the number guessed is "Too small!" or "Too big!"

The game utilizes a loop to continue running until the user guesses the correct number, at which point the loop then breaks.

This game utilizes Rust's standard library as well as the Random Number Generator.
